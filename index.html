<p><strong>BubbleTree</strong> is a library for interactive visualization of hierarchical data. Originally developed mainly for <a href="http://openspending.org">spending data</a>, the library is now completely independent from the OpenSpending platform. BubbleTree is built on top of <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">RaphaelJS</a>.</p>
